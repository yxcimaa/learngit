        <h2>There is a story about house and trees. </h2>
        <br>
        <section>feel so happy to have the chance to make a speech. </section> The title of my speech is Protect the
        Environment, Protect Ourselves. I hope you will like it.

        Everybody knows waste paper and used coke cans are discarded everywhere. You might have seen plastic bags flying
        in the sky and getting caught in the trees when the wind blows or maybe you have seen old cans floating in the
        rivers and polluting the water. Our environment is the place in which we live, but it is being ruined by us.

        There is a story about house and trees. It is said that a man’s house was surrounded by a lot of trees. Though
        the wind was strong, that man could have a good rest under the trees. How comfortable the life was! One day,
        that man wanted to enlarge his house, so he cut down all the trees. Then the autumn came without the protection.
        The strong wind blew the roof of the house into the sky. The whole house was gone with the wind. What a pity!
        But that’s the price people have to pay for destroying in the ecology balance. People shouldn’t be
        short-sighted. Protecting the environment is everyone’s task.

        <h2>she'd lean down and push my long hair out of the way, then kiss my forehead.</h2>
        <br>
        <section>Night after night, she came to tuck me in, even long after my childhood years. Following her
            longstanding
            custom,</section>


        I don't remember when it first started annoying me — her hands pushing my hair that way.
        But it did annoy me, for they felt work-worn and rough against my young skin. Finally, one night,
        I shouted out at her, "Don't do that anymore —your hands are too rough!" She didn't say anything in reply.
        But never again did my mother close out my day with that familiar expression of her love.
        Time after time, with the passing years, my thoughts returned to that night. By then I missed my mother's hands,
        missed her goodnight kiss on my forehead. Sometimes the incident seemed very close, sometimes far away. But
        always it lurked,
        in the back of my mind.

        She's been our doctor, reaching into a medicine cabinet for the remedy to calm a young girl's stomach or soothe
        the boy's scraped knee.
        She cooks the best fried chicken in the world... gets stains out of blue jeans like I never could...

        <section>Younger Generation In the Twenty-first CenturyGood evening, ladies and gentlemen.</section>
        　　We always say ‘we are the future’. Indeed. We, the younger generation represents modern knowledge, new
        concepts,
        ambition and great desire for success. But, have you ever thought of this question: how can we be successful in
        the 21st century,
        which is full of great challenges and fierce competitions? In my opinion, there are two important factors.
        Well, the years have passed, and I'm not a little girl anymore.
        Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands I once thought to be so rough are still doing things for me and my
        family.
        <ul>
            <li>First, we have to catch the opportunities and face the challenges. China has successfully entered the
                World
                Trade Organization,</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beijing has won the bid for the 2008 Olympic Games… If we want to be successful, we have to seize these
                opportunities.</li>
            <br>
            <li>SARS and AIDS, environmental pollution, growing population… We have no choice but to solve these
                problems with
                our own hands.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Thus, catching the opportunities and trying our best to cope with the difficulties is necessary for us
                to
                succeed in the 21st century.</li>
        </ul>
